# PCA-LDA model training 
 
Objective:
To train a PCA model to visualize its higher-dimensional data and to train a LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis) model to predict which of the products has been shipped and which of the products has been canceled.

Dataset Features-

The dataset consists of various features like Order number, quantity ordered, Price of each product, Order line number of the product that are important in predicting whether the product has been shipped or not.

ORDER NUMBER: Order number of the product.

QUANTITY ORDERED: Ordered quantity.

PRICEEACH: Price of each product.

ORDERLINENUMBER: Order line number of the product.

SALES: Sales of the product.
